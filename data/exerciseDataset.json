Because the fly will be the limiting factor in weight selection, this pairing is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of upper-body or chest-focused training."

The feet are elevated on a ball to align the body parallel to the floor and provide a greater stabilization challenge. This makes it more difficult than push-ups on the floor, but also puts more emphasis on the shoulder muscles. It can be a challenging non-gym substitute for incline presses, or as a burnout movement for a chest or shoulder workout."

Because you are only swinging with one arm at a time, it is also uniquely challenging to the grip and core muscles. It is often used to train explosive power, for aerobic or cardiovascular conditioning, or in circuit training."

This eliminates the stretch reflex and forces the lifter to pull with power and a bent-over spine. The Pendlay row can be performed heavy for low reps, but is usually performed for moderate reps, such as 5-8 per set."

Speed squats are popular in certain powerlifting training methodologies as a way to engrain form and lifting speed that can carry over to max-effort lifts. In this approach, they are usually performed in numerous sets of 3-5 reps with adequate rest in between. Speed squats are also sometimes performed with bands or chains adding extra resistance to the top half of the lift."

        "Description": "Incline barbell shoulder protraction The incline barbell shoulder protraction is an upper-body movement that targets strength and mobility in the scapula or shoulder blades. This can help increase pressing strength and prevent injury. It also helps develop the serratus anterior, an often-neglected muscle around the ribcage that can aid in shoulder health and upper-body muscle definition. Because it targets such small muscles, this exercise is usually performed with light weight for high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more."

        "Description": "Seated dumbbell lateral raise The seated dumbbell lateral raise is an exercise that targets the shoulder muscles, particularly the medial or middle head of the deltoids. Performing it on a bench helps enforce strict form and eliminate swinging or using momentum to move the weights. Lateral raise variations are usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of the upper-body or shoulder-focused portion of a workout."
